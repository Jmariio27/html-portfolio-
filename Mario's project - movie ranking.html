    <h1>Top movies/shows according to Mario </h1>
    <h2>My top 3 of all-time </h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>One piece </h3>
        <p>For me this is one of the greatest show ever. I love their characters, their character development,
            love their scenaries all is based in so many islands and they are pirates plus power sistem is awesome but not perfect at all  
        </p>
    <h3>The Office </h3>
        <p>Best comedy show I have seen lately, their ankward humour makes it unique
            the principal character is loved for the employees in a certain way but they do it
        </p>
    <h3>Pinocho the movie</h3>
    <p>
        In Italy during World War II, in a fit of drunken rage twenty years after losing his son Carlo to an aerial bombardment during the Great War, 
        the woodcarver Geppetto cuts down the pine tree planted in Carlo's memory and uses it to create a wooden boy.
